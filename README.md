# cs361_ascend

A small website using data from OpenBeta (https://github.com/OpenBeta) to search for climbing routes.

This project was for the CS 361 - Software Engineering I class at Oregon State University and was undertaken without a deep understanding of databases. I was proud of implementing search but the feature would heavily benefit from pagination which I learned to implement in later classes.
